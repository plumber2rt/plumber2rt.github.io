<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks beverages. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
