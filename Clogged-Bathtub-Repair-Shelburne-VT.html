<p>Once the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
