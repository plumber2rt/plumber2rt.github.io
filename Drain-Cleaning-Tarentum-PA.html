<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid generally will help eliminate them. If you wish to attempt the gentlest technique maybe try utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't suffice then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and safety warnings first!).
