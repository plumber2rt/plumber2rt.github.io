<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to split and solidify or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in great shape.</p>
