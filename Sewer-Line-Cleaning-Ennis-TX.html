<p>Leaks are sly. While the time required will differ based on your house size and the variety of found breakdowns, it's best to reserve approximately two hours when you arrange an inspection.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent to drain. This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
