Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.
