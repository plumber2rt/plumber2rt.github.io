A backflow preventer is an essential piece of equipment that enhances a facility's plumbing system. Similar to any other piece of equipment, it should be well preserved in order to be effective.

<p>When the data gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually deteriorated in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers must just be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if required, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
