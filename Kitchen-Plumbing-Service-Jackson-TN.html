In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
