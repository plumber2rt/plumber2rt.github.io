<p>Many toilets used today operate with a basic gravity flushing design, implying they use the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewer system. Recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in more and more homes. This system utilizes a vacuum-assisted flushing mechanism to suck the water into the bowl and down into the sewers. A drawback of this device is that it's much more challenging to unclog your toilet were to end up being clogged.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are a lot of quality kitchen sinks to select from. For example, many consumers choose stainless-steel undermount sinks due to the fact that they can take a fair bit of abuse for many years.

The size of the bowl as well as further alternatives regarding the faucet are all aspects of the process that we can assist you with.</p>
