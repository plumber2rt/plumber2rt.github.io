<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily saved for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
