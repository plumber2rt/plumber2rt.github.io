<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be corrected easily if the blockage is basic and shallow. For a lot of obstructions you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this does not solve the problem then you might also need to hire a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to assist.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to remove tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure called Template Assisted Formation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not adhere to any surface area in your home, keeping your devices and warm water heaters devoid of tough water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And since these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>
