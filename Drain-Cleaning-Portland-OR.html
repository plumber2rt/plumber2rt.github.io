<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing abilities if you're relatively unskilled. So conserve yourself some severe trouble by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is. Most backflow preventers are created to allow the parts to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body remains installed in the piping system. Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not needed most of the times. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be eliminated from the main body to facilitate a repair. Knowing the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the concern if this is the case.

This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
