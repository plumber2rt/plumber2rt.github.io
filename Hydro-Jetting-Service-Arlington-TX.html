<p>There are two popular mount systems used for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt mount (if you've had a disposer installed for a long time, it's most likely mounted by doing this) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each accomplish the exact same job with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name implies, the EZ Mount mechanism is planned to be simpler to deal with when installing or fixing an unit.</p>
<p>Although the professional agreed that the client did the ideal thing in her efforts to tighten up the pipes, the professional saw that the pipe had actually ended up being extremely corroded throughout the years and that a PVC pipe might be better fit for the client's requirements. He switched off the supply of water to the home, removed the rusty system and fit a PVC pipe in its location. Prior to leaving the residence, the technician restored water flow and evaluated the pipe.</p>
