Traditional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative effect on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and use no drainage, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are extremely low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last approximately 5 years without changing.
