<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Ephrata WA</h3>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

A professional plumber can have your new water heater up and running a matter of a couple hours.
