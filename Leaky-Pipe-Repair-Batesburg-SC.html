Numerous insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be rejected since the standard HO-3 house owners' policy specifically excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended amount of time."

While this might work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the same product as other pipes in your house, suggesting that problem could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you peace of mind and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>
