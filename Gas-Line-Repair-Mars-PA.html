<p>Climatic vacuum breaker. Although you may have a number of climatic vacuum breakers on your system, the water will just flow through one of them on its way to the sprinklers or emitters. Therefore, you only consist of the pressure loss for one vacuum breaker in your estimation. The majority of producers don't have pressure loss information for vacuum breakers, so presume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no manufacturer's literature is offered.</p>

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
