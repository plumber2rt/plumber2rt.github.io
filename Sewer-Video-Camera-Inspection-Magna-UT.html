<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called numerous of his member contractors to find out what a fair and reasonable  cost would be for a waste disposal unit install. Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- generally sodium. The outcome is water that's been effectively softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>
