<p>Typically nationwide, it costs in between $120 and $150 to install a garbage disposal. The average cost of garbage disposal installation depends on a number of elements: the type of garbage disposal, whether it's a brand-new disposal installation or replacement of an old system, and if extra electrical connections or plumbing work is necessary. This is where the UPC truly enters play. There are specific guidelines for where black iron gas pipes can be used, and where they can not.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
