We've already seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the distinction between them? When it concerns the issue of hard water, a standard water softener actually eliminates magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is referred to as short-lived hardness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
