If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
