Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water really requires it. Newer units use computerized sensing units that monitor bead depletion and other key metrics based upon your water usage and therefore just regenerate when needed. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
