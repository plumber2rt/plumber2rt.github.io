Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to assist the professional assemble the elements into the body without producing damage from friction. The lubricant must be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water supply is not polluted. In many cases the best lubricant is water.

As a result, we recommend replacing your system if it is over ten years old. Under no situations should you ever attempt to fix gas leakages yourself.

The water is constantly heated as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is right away turned off, the water stops being warmed. The heating temperature level is typically pre-set to fit your requirements and preferences. Due to the fact that they only heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than standard water heaters.</p>
