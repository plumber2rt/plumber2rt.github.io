Since we first opened in 1953, our water softeners have made a difference in the lives of countless house owners in North America and worldwide. Our premium system, the EC4 entire house water softener, is a state-of-the-art item that utilizes a process of ion exchange to remove the minerals that cause tough water. By changing the calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate ions that trigger water hardness with sodium or potassium ions, the EC4 softens tough water by addressing its source. Furthermore, thanks to its unique, built-in microprocessor, the EC4 system will discover your common water usage patterns, changing its soft water delivery based upon your needs. In this way, our premium water softener guarantees that you'll have an unlimited supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
<p>This ion exchange procedure is facilitated by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another mix that can work on sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. You can repeat this process if it doesn't work the first time. We do hot water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
