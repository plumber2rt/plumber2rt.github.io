A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the new heater.

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

We likewise had to replace a bathroom and a water heater unassociated to the fire, however we felt confident in Joe's abilities. We decided to stay with Joe, despite the fact that we felt Mr Rooter costs were absolutely on the luxury. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
