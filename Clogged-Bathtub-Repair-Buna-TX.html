<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
