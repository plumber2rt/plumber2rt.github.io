<p>If you identify a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping task, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same product and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole house when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
