How frequently a toilet blockages depends upon the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush.

<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out annual forward circulation tests are in some cases perceived as a required to have them.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to break and solidify or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever remains in good shape.</p>
