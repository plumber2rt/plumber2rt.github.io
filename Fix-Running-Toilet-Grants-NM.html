<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female believed the price she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things differently could have conserved her a lot of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>If you have to hardwire the system, wait until it's installed under the sink. Note: It's most likely a great concept to shut off power at the breaker now, so as to avoid forgetting to shut it off later on.
