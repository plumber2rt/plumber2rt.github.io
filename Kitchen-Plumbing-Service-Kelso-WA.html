<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense.

When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force.
