<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
