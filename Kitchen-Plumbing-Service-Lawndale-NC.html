<p>With drain line cleaning, you understand your pipes are sparkly clean. With repairs, you understand they're in good condition. And with lining, you know they'll be protected for years to come. As a house owner or entrepreneur, those reassurances can be really, very great to hear.

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
