<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
