Older toilets might work just great, but if your toilet is truly old (and dated in style), you may want to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
