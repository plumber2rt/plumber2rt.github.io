<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house, this is one of the very first and main concerns that you need to ask yourself. The age of your house is a crucial element to understand whether or not you need to repipe your house.

If your home was constructed prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping.
