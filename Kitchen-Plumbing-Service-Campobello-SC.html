<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has actually currently been fouled. Once again, it is recommended to examine the producer's directions for special precautions.</p>
<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to service? The timing of regeneration depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water actually needs it. Newer units use electronic sensors that keep track of bead exhaustion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regrow when required. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
