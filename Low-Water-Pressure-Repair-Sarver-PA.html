<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
