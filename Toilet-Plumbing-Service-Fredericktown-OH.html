This neighborhood water network contains numerous users where there is a danger to public health if there is a cross-connection in between the water system and a polluted source.

<p>Lastly, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
