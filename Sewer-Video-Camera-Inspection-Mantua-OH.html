<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
