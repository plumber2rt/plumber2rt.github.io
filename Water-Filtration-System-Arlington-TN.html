<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
