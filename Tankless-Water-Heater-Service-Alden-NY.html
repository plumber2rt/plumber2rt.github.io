When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
