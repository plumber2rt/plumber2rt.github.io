<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>

<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
