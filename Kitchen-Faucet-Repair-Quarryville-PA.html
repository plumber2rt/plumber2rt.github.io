<p>People generally update their devices from electrical to natural gas due to the fact that it's more cost-effective. After converting, savings of approximately 30% have been reported. In addition to cost savings for energy costs, some energy companies provide refunds to install gas appliances. The average cost to run a gas line into a small house is between $307 for one room to $920 for 3 spaces.
