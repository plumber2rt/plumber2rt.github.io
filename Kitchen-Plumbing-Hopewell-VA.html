<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is needed to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming.

Additionally, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>

As a center supervisor, understanding how to take care of your backflow preventer will keep it working correctly for as long as possible.</p>
