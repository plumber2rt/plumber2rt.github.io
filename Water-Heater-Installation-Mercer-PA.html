<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
