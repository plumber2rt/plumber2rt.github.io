<p>Garbage disposals are designed to work in one of 2 ways. Either through what's called a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered before it is switched on, or through a continuous feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running. An authorized backflow prevention device, which must be evaluated every year, need to be installed on the service connection that the department has identified as having a capacity for backflow.

<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation.
