If Your Drains Are Sluggish, Call us For Professional Drain Cleaning. Plumbers are now able to utilize video technology to view inside sewer and water lines. A tiny camera attached to a cable is placed into a line or a pipe and sends video footage to the plumber. This tool can be important in identifying problems and assisting a plumber strategy repairs. The next level up, in terms of price and protection offered, is called a pressure vacuum breaker, or PVB. This device prevents back siphonage only.
