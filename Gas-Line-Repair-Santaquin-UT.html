In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are caught and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any leftover impurities.</p>
<p>Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and particular other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water is more suitable with soap and extends the lifetime of some appliances. Water softening is generally attained utilizing ion-exchange resins.
