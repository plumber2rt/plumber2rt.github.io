<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to get away.
