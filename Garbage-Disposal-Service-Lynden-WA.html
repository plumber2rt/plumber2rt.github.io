<p>When selecting an insured and licensed plumbing contractor is just an easy phone call away, why run the risk of an insurance coverage claim on a flooded house. LM Construction and Mechanical is the hot water heater installation and replacement professional in Santa Fe, our group has actually installed and changed thousands of water heaters throughout northern New Mexico. If your water heater is 15 years of ages or more, it may be time to get new warm water heater installed if your guarantee has expired.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. Most water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
