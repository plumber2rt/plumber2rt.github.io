<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Delavan WI</h3>

Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Electrolysis: This approach uses what is basically a battery. Metal electrodes are immersed in the water and release positive zinc ions, which also release electrons that move through the wire to the cathode.
