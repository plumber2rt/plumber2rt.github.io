Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads.

<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Lancaster SC</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its many desired uses around your home.</p>

Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dingy gray triggered by hard water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, repairing, replacing and servicing our softener.
