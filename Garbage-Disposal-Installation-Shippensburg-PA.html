<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
