<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing business. A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>To link a power cable to the new system, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cable, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you water with drinkable water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, safe and clean and watering, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
