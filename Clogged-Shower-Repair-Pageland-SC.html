I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
