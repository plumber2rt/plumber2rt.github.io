<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
