<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Gaston SC</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
