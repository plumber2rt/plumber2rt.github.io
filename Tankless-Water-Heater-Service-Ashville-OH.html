<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
