Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem.

<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in Hornell NY</h3>
<p>In addition to serving your house's plumbing service and repair needs, IT Landes ® also offers a range of water conditioning solutions that are designed to improve your home's water quality. An efficient softener can reduce yearly detergent costs by more than $6,000. Many business owners presume that since they have a softener installed, they are currently understanding these cost savings. However, that is not constantly the case. You might be amazed by the results if you have not checked the softness of your water given that the system has been installed.</p>
<p>Provide us a call as soon as you observe any of these signs. Our Pittsburgh drain cleaning and repair experts have substantial experience squashing obstructions and cleaning drains.

Age-- As we mentioned, a 10+ year old water heater is most likely on its last legs. If you are uncertain how old your system is, you need to be able to get that information from the serial number on the producer's sticker label (generally near the top of the unit). Generally, the first 2 numbers suggest the year of your water heater.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Once again, it is a good idea to check the producer's instructions for unique preventative measures.</p>
