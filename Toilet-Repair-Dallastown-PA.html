<p>Homeowners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is particularly prudent to arrange inspections on a yearly basis and when purchasing a new home. If Your Drains Are Sluggish, Call us For Professional Drain Cleaning. Plumbers are now able to use video technology to see inside sewer and water lines. A tiny camera affixed to a cable is placed into a pipe or a line and sends video footage to the plumber. This tool can be indispensable in detecting problems and helping a plumber plan repairs. The next level up, in terms of price and protection supplied, is called a pressure vacuum breaker, or PVB. This device prevents back siphonage just. A pressure vacuum breaker has a spring-loaded check valve that will close whenever water stops streaming with an air relief valve that opens to break the siphon when pressure drops to 1 PSI.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
