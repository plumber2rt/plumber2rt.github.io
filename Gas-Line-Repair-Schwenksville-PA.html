I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
