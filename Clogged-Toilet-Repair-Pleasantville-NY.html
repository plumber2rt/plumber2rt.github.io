<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to leave.
