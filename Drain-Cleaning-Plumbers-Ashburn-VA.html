I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
