Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new homes, however numerous houses constructed between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be gotten rid of by a professional plumber when found and changed with another pipe product. Sump and sedimentation manholes separate the stormwater from sanitary water, minimizing the volume and cost of treatment. Culvert repair diverts storm run-off and lessens erosion and run-off.
