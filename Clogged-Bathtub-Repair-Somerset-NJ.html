<p>Little Leaks - A leak does not always imply that your water heater's going, it might simply be condensation. However it likewise could mean that your tank welds or pipe fittings are used. A plumber is needed if this is the case. When most people think about plumbers, they usually call them for water pipe concerns.

<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
