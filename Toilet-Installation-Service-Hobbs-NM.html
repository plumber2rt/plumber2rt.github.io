Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
