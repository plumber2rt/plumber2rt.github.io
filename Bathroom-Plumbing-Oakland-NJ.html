<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to leave. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
