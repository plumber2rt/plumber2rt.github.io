<p>Many homeowners don't quite understand what a plumbing inspection truly is. Help! My water heater isn't working effectively. Come and examine it!" is not how they are intended to work. Inspections are designed to provide you with a total picture of your plumbing system's health, instant requirements, and future jobs.

Products consist of pipes, valves and fasteners. The size of the pipes need to be proportional to the size of the appliance being installed.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal.
