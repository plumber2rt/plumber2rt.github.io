Double Check Valve assemblies are the most common type used on watering systems in Horseshoe Bay.

There's an excellent chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away.

<p>Typically nationwide, it costs between $120 and $150 to install a garbage disposal.

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they slowly start to restrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you see it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
