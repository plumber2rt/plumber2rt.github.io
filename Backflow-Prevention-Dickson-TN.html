<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female thought the price she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things in a different way could have saved her a great deal of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect gradually, they gradually start to constrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you see it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
