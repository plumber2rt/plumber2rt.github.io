<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
