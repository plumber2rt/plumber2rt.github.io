Most plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters discover their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship.

Technical guideline includes safety, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and organisations. Most apprentices go into a program directly, however some start out as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
