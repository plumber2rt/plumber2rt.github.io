<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Again, it is a good idea to examine the manufacturer's instructions for special safety measures.</p>

If it is close to the number of years the hot water heater was ranked for, consider replacement instead of repair.</p>
