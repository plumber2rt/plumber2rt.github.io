<p>If you're fairly unskilled, a hot water heater installation is not the repair on which to sharpen your plumbing skills. So save yourself some serious trouble by being sincere with yourself about where your experience level is. Most backflow preventers are designed to allow the elements to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body remains installed in the piping system.
