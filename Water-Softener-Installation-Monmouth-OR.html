<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to service? The timing of regeneration depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water actually needs it. When needed, newer systems use digital sensors that monitor bead deficiency and other essential metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just restore. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
