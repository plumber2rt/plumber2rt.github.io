<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Tough water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>

In this case, you'll need skilled plumbers as well as foundation repair experts.
