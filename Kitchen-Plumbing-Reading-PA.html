The salt or potassium chloride is a sacrificial media and need to be renewed on a regular basis to ensure adequate softening form the device.</p>
<p>To assist prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the technique laid out above. Because the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
